<!-- Placeholder Image Instructions -->
<!--
To complete your portfolio, you'll need to add the following images to the assets/images/ folder:

1. profile.jpg (400x400px) - Your main profile photo for the hero section
2. about.jpg (500x600px) - A photo of you for the about section
3. project1.jpg (400x250px) - Screenshot of your first project
4. project2.jpg (400x250px) - Screenshot of your second project
5. project3.jpg (400x250px) - Screenshot of your third project
6. project4.jpg (400x250px) - Screenshot of your fourth project

For now, you can use placeholder services like:
- https://picsum.photos/400/400 for profile.jpg
- https://picsum.photos/500/600 for about.jpg
- https://picsum.photos/400/250 for project images

To replace placeholders with your actual images:
1. Take/prepare your photos
2. Resize them to the recommended dimensions
3. Save them in the assets/images/ folder with the correct names
4. The website will automatically display your images

Tips for better images:
- Use high-quality photos with good lighting
- Ensure project screenshots clearly show your work
- Consider using a consistent style/filter for project images
- Optimize images for web (use tools like TinyPNG)
